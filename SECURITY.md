# Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The derivations made to the original work should not cause any security issues, since they are all visual. However, security issues do surface unexpectedly from time to time, and if that were to happen it is recommended to contact Ghost directly.  See the upstream fork's SECURITY.md file for instructions on what to do.
